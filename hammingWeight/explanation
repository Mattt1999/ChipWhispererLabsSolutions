Purpose of this exercise is to observe the fact that handling different inputs (in this case inputs with large/small Hamming weights - no of bits of 1 set in a variable) reflect in the MCU's power consumption. 

For this, we will feed multiple pieces of data - arrays of length 16 - to the MCU, with the property that the first byte of each array is either 0x00 or 0xFF.

We will create two separate lists - one containing the power traces corresponding to inputs starting with 0x00 and the other one to inputs starting with 0xFF. 

After this, we will compute the average of each list (for each trace in each point) and plot the difference between the averages of the lists starting with 1 and with 0. The outcome will be a large spike near the beginning of the plot.
